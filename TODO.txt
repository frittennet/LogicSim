- Initial Numbers ( for presets like custom made constant value smaller-than nodes ) into API::createSimulation(); 
- paginated LZ compression for states ( bacause the program uses about 1GB of ram every 10 seconds without it ) 
- Unit Tests ??? 
- Implement all Nodes 
- Create proper deltas in APISimulationState ( to further compress amount of memory needed )
