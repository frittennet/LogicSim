- paginated LZ compression for states ( bacause the program uses about 1GB of ram every 10 seconds without it ) 
- Unit Tests ??? 
- Implement all Nodes 
- Create proper deltas in APISimulationState ( to further compress amount of memory needed ) 
- Pre-Define Outputs and run simulation up to n ticks return result this is a secondary mode to test the solution in a rigerous manner
